# [Your Name]'s Portfolio Website

This is the GitHub repository for my personal portfolio website, built using ReactJS, MongoDB, Express and JavaScript. The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills and experience as a junior software developer, and to provide potential employers and clients with an overview of my work.

## Features
- Home page with a brief introduction and links to my resume and social media profiles
- Projects page with descriptions and links to my featured projects
- Skills page with a list of my technical skills
- Contact page with a form to get in touch with me

## Installation
To run the application locally, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. Please note that you will also need to configure your own MongoDB instance to store data from the contact form.

## Usage
Feel free to use this project as a template for your own portfolio website, or to contribute to the codebase if you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
